    <p> These are my bestfriends. I love them with my whole heart. We do fun things all the time and were always with one another any time of the day. </p>
    <p> I also love to dance. I dance 6 days a week. I dance all styles from ballet, to flamenco, to hiphop, and so on. These are a few pictures of me during shows. </p>
