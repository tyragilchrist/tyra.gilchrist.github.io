<p> Hi. You've opened my extra cirrcular's page. You will see all the activities I do in and after school.</p>
<p> I do alot of activities, starting at school I am in Key Club and I am the Sophmore Representative, my schools dance team, First Priority Club, and Black History Club. Then outside of school I am in and the Miami Chapter President of Top Teens Of America, I am the President of Eta Phi Beta's Youth Group, I am Vice President of the Youth Mission at my church, I am a youth group member of the National Congress of Negro Women, and I do alot of activties at my church. I am very involved in my church youth groups teen session Keepin' It Real, Youth Mission, Youth Choir Reherseal, Youth Street Mission, and a productive member of the Youth Department. I like to be involved in the community and work with people which is where my service organiaztions like Top Teens of America, and Eta Phi Beta Youth Gorup come in. I also dance alot. I dance from Monday-Saturday at my ballet studio 'Ballet Etudes.' It is a very good studio. I recently joined this new program called Girls Who Code. Is very intresting and it is a great environment to learn something, contribute, and meet new people. Girls Who Code allows you to express yourself as an individual while working with others and doing new and cool projects. To see all of my orginaztaions websites and what they do just click on the links below. I also have pictures of me in some of these organizations. You can also take look at one of my projects from Girls Who Code its a side scroller pirate game!
